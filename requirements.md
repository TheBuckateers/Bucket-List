## Vision

- The vision of Travel Bucket List Generator helps you pick countries you want to visit. It will allow you to save your favorite countries, recipes to try until you get to travel and comments about your trip planning.

- The pain point this solves is to scratch the travel itch that COVID restrictions have caused.

- This can be used well after COVID as way to research a country you are interested in visting. It can give you a little information about the country, a few foods/recipes to try, currency, travel documentation needed, some environmental concerns, travel restrictions. You can even save comments about your planning.

## Scope (In/Out)

- In
  Search for country(ies) to get more information/start a Bucket to add to Bucket List(account).
  Shows random Buckets of countries to try.
  Offers user ability to Like, Add, Get More Info on Buckets. Must login to Add or Like.
  Can add, edit, delete comments.
